<h1> Welcome! </h1>
<hr>

<p style="margin-bottom: 35px;"> 
  Heartily welcome on my website, a platform designed to share ideas, knowledge and more! I have always thought of science as being a kind of universe 
  in which planets play the role of scientific fields. From this metaphorical perspective one could think of our minds being the main actors, 
  trying to grasp the complexity of our surroundings and conquer the mysteries of science with spacecrafts named Logic, Hypotheses and Determination. 
  State-of-the art science has brought the knowledge levels in technology, medicine, physics and many other disciplines to unprecedented heights and yet 
  a plethora of facets still wait to be discovered.&nbsp; As Einstein put it: "intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death", so let your beautiful mind
  dive deep into this universe to explore new horizons.</p>	

<h1> My scientific journey so far </h1>

<p style="margin-bottom: 35px;">
‘‘I have always been fascinated by science for the simple reason that it has enlightened humans for millennia and will challenge the yet unborn generations 
for future breakthroughs in the quest for understanding and explaining a mysteriously complex universe.’’

 

My scientific journey started in 2008 at the University of Luxembourg during a three year Bachelor program in Economics with a couple of months spent at 
Université Paris II (Panthéon-Assas) in the framework of the Erasmus exchange program. Afterwards, I moved to Belgium and graduated from the Université
 catholique de Louvain with three Master's degrees: Econometrics (2013), Statistics (2015) and Biostatistics (2019). In 2020, I obtained a PhD of
 Science (Statistics) from the Université catholique de Louvain. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Data Science Institute of Hasselt University.

<h1> Research interests </h1>
<hr>
	
<p style="margin-bottom: 35px;">
I am particularly interested in Bayesian Statistics, Functional Data Analysis, Computational Methods in Statistics and Survival Models. As an R enthusiast, I developed a package during my doctoral thesis focused on approximate Bayesian methods. It can be used to fit survival models and (generalized) additive models in a Bayesian framework by combining penalized regression splines (P-splines) and Laplace approximations. More information on this project can be found at <a href="https://www.blapsr-project.org/" target="_blank"> www.blapsr-project.org </a>. The software can be downloaded on <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=blapsr" target="_blank"> CRAN </a> or on my  <a href="https://github.com/oswaldogressani/blapsr" target="_blank"> Github </a> page .
